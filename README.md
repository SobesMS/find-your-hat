# **Find Your Hat**
### A Codecademy Challenge Project
---
This project is from the Front-End Engineer career path on Codecademy. The concept is to build an interactive terminal game where a character must find their hat in a field full of holes. If they find the hat they win but if they fall down a hole or walk off of the field, they lose.
